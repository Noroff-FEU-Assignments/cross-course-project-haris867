An e-commerce site for the fictional brand RainyDays, made with pure HTML, CSS & JavaScript.

## Description

This site was created using pure HTML, CSS & JavaScript to demonstrate how much we'd learned about these languages.

It's an e-commerce site designed by me, which is also responsive and WCAG-compliant.

I was tasked with creating an online store/e-commerce site for a fictional brand called RainyDays, which supply rain coats. 

The products are stored on a WordPress installation used as a headless CMS, and fetched using the WordPress REST API.
